<p style="text-align:center;"><b>Shitpost</b> (<i>plural 
<b>shitposts</b></i>), 
noun</br>
1. A worthless post on a messageboard, newsgroup, or other online 
discussion platform. Usually inane.</p></br>
<hr>
<p>#Shitpost is an online community of like-minded friends and 
fellows, formed from the former online communities of numerous 
imageboards created by original founder and shitpost-original, 
<b>Illu</b>. Up until late 2015, early 2016, #shitpost boasted an 
active channel on Rizon and a continuously growing base of people, as 
well as several new services made to entertain and delight users. 
However, following a steep dropoff in activity, #shitpost slowly 
became inactive until late 2017, when it was revived by longtime 
member, Dredd // Rosemary. Since then, #shitpost has reformed with a 
particular dedication to its roots, and several services for its 
members are being built up. </br></br>

Within the early months of 2018, we hope to have the following goals 
accomplished:</br>

<ul>
<li>A functioning imap email service.</li>
<li>A set usenet group to congregate at.</li>
<li>A fully-staffed mod-team.</li>
<li>Twitter.</li>
<li>Much, much more.</li>
</ul></br></br>

Check back soon to hear from us. And don't forget -- <b>You're here 
forever.</b></p>
